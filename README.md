I've created the app as a problem solving in a DC warehouse where workes could check their current/daily performance.
Instead of going to the office and checking how are they doing, they could just install an app that reads a csv file with all the workers performance.
User had to specify their individual login and could acces their performance.
As a project made for myself I didn't included passwords for individual accounts.
